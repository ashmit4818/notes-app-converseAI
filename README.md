# 📝 Notes App (React + localStorage)

This is a simple Notes App built with **React** and **localStorage** for persistent storage.  
It allows users to create, save, and delete personal notes — all without a backend!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add and delete notes
- Persist notes in localStorage
- Error handling for storage issues
- Fully responsive and styled using TailwindCSS

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions: Why This Way?

- **Why localStorage**  
  Simple, built-in browser storage — no server or database setup required. Ideal for small personal projects.

- **Why this key naming strategy (`notes`)**  
  Unique and scoped key prevents collision with other apps using localStorage.

- **Why useState + submit handler**  
  Keeps form state tightly controlled. Easy to reset fields and handle errors with a single submit function.

- **Why useEffect to sync storage → state**  
  Loads stored notes just once on initial render and updates the app state reliably. Prevents unnecessary re-renders.

- **Why this nav approach**  
  No routing libraries used — this app is kept minimal, so conditional rendering with state was the simplest and cleanest choice.

- **Why display error banner**  
  Gives clear visual feedback when something goes wrong with storage operations.

- **Styling approach and why**  
  Used **TailwindCSS** for rapid, utility-first styling without needing to write separate CSS files. Also allows easy responsiveness and consistency.

- **Why this component structure**  
  Each component (`AddNote`, `NotesList`, etc.) has a single responsibility, making code modular, readable, and maintainable.
